# Bits & Bobs

A simple but powerful app to keep track of your collections — a tracker for your personal items, experiences, and goals. 

We all have little things we want to keep track of. Maybe you’re looking to keep a record of your most prized possessions, a catalog of your vintage memorabilia, or your proudest collection of figurines. A top-10 list for your favorite movies you’ve watched or restaurants you’ve tried. Maybe a list of souvenirs from your favorite places you’ve visited, or even a checklist of all the places you want to visit in the future. Whatever you’re collecting, Bits & Bobs can help.

Create a new collection in the app, and then add all the items in your collection to it. You can write descriptions for each item and put in images. There’s also item attributes – properties of whatever you’re collecting – which you’ll set up for the entire collection, and then give each item a value for. They can be numerical, text-based, or true/false. With each item having its own value, you can sort all the items in the collection or group them together by their attributes. 

We hope the app will be useful to you in keeping track of your own bits and bobs!
